# Midterm Lab Task 3
This portfolio is about creating an interactive Data Science Salary & Job Trends Dashboard using Excel. It analyzes job distribution, salary trends by role and company size, and sector-wise employment patterns through pivot tables, charts, slicers, and an optional map for visualization.

## Step by Step Process

### 1. Use the given data
- Open the Worksheet on Uncleaned DS Jobs and the Transform Tables:
- Sal By Role
- Sal By State
- Sal By Size
  
### 2. Design the dashboard to highlight the following:
- State with the most Data Science jobs
- Job role with the highest average salary
- Company size that pays the highest salary
- Sector with the lowest & highest number of Data Science jobs
- Sector with the minimum & maximum average salary

### 3. Create a pivot table
- Use pivot tables to summarize data for sector jobs and salary (d & e)

### 4. Generate charts for reports
- Use bar, column, or pie charts to visualize salary trends and job distribution

### 5. Insert slicers for filtering
- Add slicers for role type, company size, and state to make the dashboard interactive

### 6. Add a map (optional)
- If available in your Excel version, insert a map visualization to show job distribution by state

### 7. Apply design & formatting
- Customize the colors, fonts, and layout to make the dashboard visually appealing

### 8. Complete the dashboard
- Ensure all required visuals and reports are included
- The slicers should be functional and interactive
