# Midterm Lab Task 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation Using Power Query Editor
## Task Description: 
To extract useful information from the file UncleanedDSJObs.csv taken from a Job Posting site available in Kaggle.  
## To find out:
- Which Job Roles pay the highest and least
- What size companies pay the best
- Where Job Roles or Job Titles pay the best and least in a specific state
## Dataset Before Cleaning and Transformation:
[Uncleaned DS Jobs](https://github.com/rxnz03/EDM-Portfolio/blob/main/Midterm%20Lab%20Task%202/Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv)

## Steps Performed in Data Cleaning and Transformation:
- Duplicated the raw data to preserve the original.  
- Cleaned the salary estimate column by removing everything after the "(" symbol.  
- Created Min Sal and Max Sal columns from the salary estimate.  
- Added a new column Role Type to classify jobs as "data scientist", "data analyst", "data engineer", "machine learning engineer", or "other" based on the job title.  
- Corrected the location column with custom states and split it into city and state abbreviation.  
- Replaced incorrect state entries (e.g., "anne rundell" to "ma").  
- Split the company size column to extract MinCompanySize and MaxCompanySize, and removed the word "employees".  
- Replaced invalid or negative values:  
- Competitors: replaced -1 with "n/a".  
- Revenue: replaced negatives with 0.  
- Industry: replaced -1 with "other".  
- Cleaned company name by removing extra ratings or numbers at the end.  
- Removed unnecessary columns like job descriptions.  
- Duplicated the cleaned data as Sal By Role Type dup, selected Role Type, Min Sal, and Max Sal, converted salaries to currency, multiplied by 1000, and grouped by - Role Type to get average salaries.  
- Created a reference as Sal By Role Size ref, selected Size, Min Sal, and Max Sal, multiplied salaries by 1000, and grouped by Size to get average salaries.  
- Imported a State Mapping file to map state abbreviations to full state names and merged it with the dataset.  
- Created a reference as Sal By State ref, selected State Full Name, Min Sal, and Max Sal, multiplied salaries by 1000, and grouped by State Full Name to get average salaries.  
- Checked query dependencies to confirm correct relationships.
